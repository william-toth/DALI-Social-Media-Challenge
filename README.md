# DALI Social Media Challenge

Deployed [HERE](https://dali-social-media-challenge.netlify.app/) and the profiles page is [here](https://dali-social-media-challenge.netlify.app/profiles)

**Note:** The backend/api I created is under a different github repo linked [here](https://github.com/william-toth/DALI-Social-Media-API)

Hi. Welcome to my submission for the DALI developer challenge. I have chosen to do both the front end and back end challenges, with the front end hosted on Netlify and the back on Heroku. The front end uses React, Redux, and React Bootstrap, and there are a few features here. First is the profiles. Click the profiles link in the nav bar to see a list of all profiles. To view more information on a DALI member, you can click the button on the bottom of a profile tile. While these user profiles are not stored in any database, the posts are (using MongoDB along with an API I made). The API supports `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` routes. Go ahead, add a new post, or delete one!! In addition, the activity bar at the moment is mostly for aesthetics and does not represent any change in the database (as there is no login functionality right now nor is there anyone using this social media). Enjoy!!
